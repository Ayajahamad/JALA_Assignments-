### 1. Understanding Table Structure:

Tables in HTML are structured using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements.

- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a row in the table.
- `<th>`: Defines a header cell in the table. By default, the content of `<th>` is bold and centered.
- `<td>`: Defines a standard data cell in the table.

Example:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### 2. Cell Padding and Cell Spacing:

- Cell Padding: It defines the space between the content of a cell and its border.
  ```html
  <table cellpadding="10">
  ```
  In CSS:
  ```css
  table {
      border-collapse: collapse; /* Remove default cell spacing */
  }
  td {
      padding: 10px; /* Apply padding to all cells */
  }
  ```

- Cell Spacing: It defines the space between cells.
  ```html
  <table cellspacing="10">
  ```
  In CSS, cell spacing is controlled by the `border-spacing` property:
  ```css
  table {
      border-spacing: 10px; /* Apply spacing between cells */
  }
  ```

### 3. Form Attributes:

Forms in HTML allow users to input data. They are created using the `<form>` element and contain various form controls like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc. Form controls can have attributes to specify their behavior and appearance.

Common form attributes include:
- action: Specifies where to send the form data when submitted.
- method: Defines how form data should be submitted (GET or POST).
- name: Assigns a name to the form.
- target: Specifies where to open the response from the server (e.g., in a new window).
- autocomplete: Controls whether a form should have autocomplete enabled or disabled.
- enctype: Specifies how form data should be encoded before sending it to the server (e.g., `multipart/form-data` for file uploads).
- novalidate: Prevents form validation when submitted.

Example:
```html
<form action="/submit" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" autocomplete="off" required>
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
