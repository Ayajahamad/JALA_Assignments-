### 1. Importance of HTML DOCTYPE

The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration is crucial in HTML documents for several reasons:

1. **Standards Mode vs. Quirks Mode**:
    - The DOCTYPE declaration tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in, which helps the browser render the page correctly.
    - Without a proper DOCTYPE, browsers might switch to "quirks mode," which attempts to mimic the non-standard behavior of older browsers. This can result in inconsistent rendering across different browsers.

2. **Validation**:
    - The DOCTYPE helps validators check the document against a set of rules, ensuring that the HTML is correctly structured and follows standards. This is important for maintaining clean, maintainable code.

3. **Forward Compatibility**:
    - Using a correct DOCTYPE helps future-proof your pages, as it ensures they adhere to established standards, reducing the risk of issues when browsers are updated or new ones are released.

4. **SEO and Accessibility**:
    - Correctly formatted and validated HTML documents are more likely to be correctly interpreted by search engines and accessibility tools, leading to better SEO and improved accessibility for users with disabilities.

The most common DOCTYPE for modern web development is the HTML5 DOCTYPE:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### 2. Syntax to Link External Style Sheet

To link an external stylesheet in an HTML document, you use the `<link>` element inside the `<head>` section of your HTML. The syntax is as follows:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/stylesheet.css">
```

- **`rel="stylesheet"`**: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked file. For stylesheets, this value is always "stylesheet".
- **`href="path/to/your/stylesheet.css"`**: Specifies the URL of the stylesheet you want to link. This can be a relative or absolute path.

Here's a complete example of an HTML document linking an external stylesheet:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is an example page with an external stylesheet.</p>
</body>
</html>
```.
