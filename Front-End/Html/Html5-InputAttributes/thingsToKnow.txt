- The `required` attribute is used to make all fields mandatory.
- The `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `min`, `max` attributes are applied to limit the length and value of certain fields.
- The `autocomplete` attribute is used to specify that the browser should autocomplete the username field if possible.
- The `placeholder` attribute provides hints to users about the expected format of the input.
- The form is styled for better presentation using CSS.

Regarding the difference between `target="_blank"` and `target="_self"`:

- `target="_blank"`: This attribute specifies that the linked document should open in a new tab or window. This is typically used when you want to keep the current page intact and open the linked document separately.
- `target="_self"`: This attribute specifies that the linked document should open in the same frame or tab as the current page. This is the default behavior if no target attribute is specified.
